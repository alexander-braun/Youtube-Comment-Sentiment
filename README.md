This is a sentiment analyser for youtube comments.
The app takes the last 100 comments and calculates an averaged sentiment from all the comments.
It sorts comments by sentiment and finds the highest- and lowest ranking comments for a given
video link. As a little feature, the user gets a bubblechart visualization for frequent used
keywords in comments as well as a chart for used positive and negative words.
The App makes use of natural, keyword_extractor and the youtube api.

Build with React, Redux, D3 and a little MaterialUI.
